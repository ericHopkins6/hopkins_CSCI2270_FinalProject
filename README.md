All-Star Arena

Summary:
	This is a battle arena game.  The characters are pre-set and can be viewed
from the opening screen, along with all their fighting statistics.  The user then chooses which
characters will be on their team by first selecting the size of the team. The computer
will then populate its team with an equal number of characters: able to select 
the same characters more than once and characters that are on the user's team. The 
user can change their own or the computer's team before heading to battle.  In battle,
there is a chance that the characters, based on their special statistics, can auto-
matically win due to random occurrences.  If both characters get this ability, 
both characters are kept alive, able to be used again.  In addition to automatically 
winning the match, the characters can get a speed boost, due to random occurrences, 
that will increase their attack and defence statistics.  Lastly, whoever has the higher
value of attacker's attack versus defender's defence wins the battle.  This continues
until one side has no more characters, forcing that side to lose.  The user can move
within menus freely, except in battle where the only exit besides winning or losing
is concession.  The user can play as many times as desired until quitting the game.

How to Run:
	From the opening menu, the user can select options 1 through 4 by typing in that
number.  Option 1 will list all the characters in the game. No additional characters
may be added.  Option 2 will prompt the user for a character name so that their 
statistics may be viewed.  Option 3 will enter the arena function of the game. Option
4 will quit the game.
	Inside the arena function, there are options 1 through 6, accessed by typing in
that number.  Option 1 will first prompt the user for the desired size of their team,
team size ranging from 1 to 5. Then it will print out all the fighters, and, for the 
size of the team selected, will prompt the user for a name of the fighter to add.
Option 1 will also allow the user to reselect their team once this option has already
been pressed.  After option one has been picked, the computer will randomly select
characters for their team of equal size.  Option 2 will show the user's selected team.
Option 3 will make the computer reselect, randomly, their team of equal size of the
user's without reusing the user's characters.  Option 4 will display the team of the 
computer.  Option 5 will enter the battle function.  No changes to either team can be 
made after selecting option 5 without conceding the fight to the computer.  Option 6 
will put the user back out at the open menu.
	Inside the battle function, the first opponent of the user will be displayed. From
here, the user can either type the name of their desired first proponent, or type 
"concede" to quit the battle, yielding to the computer. The result of the battle will be shown.  If either character is defeated,
that character is no longer available for battle.  If the two characters draw, both
characters are able to fight again.  The user will then be routed back to the battle
screen.  This process continues until one team has been completely depleted or the user
types "concede".  When the user wins, loses, or concedes, they are put back
to the arena menu.  Both teams are completely erased at this point.
	You are able to freely move between menus at any time. Note: Leaving the battle 
menu before completing the match would require you to concede to the computer.
